# A* Assembly

Project carried out for project classes of the subject **Assembler Programming Languages**.

## Introduction
Our task will be to implement our chosen algorithm in both C++ and Assembler. We will then compare the performance of the two implementations. One of the main goals is that the assembler implementation should be faster. The application should provide a simple graphical interface to run the algorithm and compare both results.

The algorithm we will try to implement is:  **A\* Search Algorithm**.
